### SPMD Tutorial

The intel® ®SPMD program compiler based on llvm* (commonly referred to as ISPC in previous documents) is not a substitute for gnu* compiler Suite (GCC) or microsoft* C + + compiler; it's more like the C- A PU shader compiler that generates vector directives for a variety of instruction sets, such as the intel® ®SIMD streaming instruction Extension 2 (intel® ®sse2), the intel® ®simd streaming instruction Extension 4 (Intel ®sse4), the intel® Advanced Vector Extensions instruction set (Intel ®AVX), Intel ®avx2, and so on 。 Enter a shader or kernel based on C to output the precompiled object file, and your application will contain a header file. By using a small number of keywords, the compiler can get explicit instructions on how to assign work on a CPU vector unit.
